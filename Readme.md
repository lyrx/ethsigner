# A Digital Printing Machine

- Treat ebooks like books, limiting them to a specific  number of copies
- There will be a script automatically editing each book by adding a signature based on 
  an Ethereum address, plus a unique serial number.
    - That will make the hash value of each copy unique.
    - Each copy can subsequently be uploaded to IPFS, maintaining uniqueness
- Finally this project will contain scripts providing a process similar to a signing and printing 
  machine. 
    - Sign each copy automatically and individually
    - Upload each copy to IPFS automatically
- Another repo will be used to provide a shop frontend based on Next.JS / Vercel
