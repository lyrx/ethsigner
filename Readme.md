# The Galactic Library Of Intellectual Property
![](library.webp)

## Summary

The "Galactic Library of Intellectual Property" **(GLIP)** introduces an innovative approach to redefining the business model of intellectual property. This project deconstructs ebooks and online articles into accessible and tradable segments, stored in databases. Content is offered on an "all-you-can-read" basis, rather than as complete works, shifting the paradigm from ownership of entire texts to access to portions of content.

## Overview 

There is a misconception that has not been overcome since we can
send and store information digitally.

It is mistakenly believed that **books** can exist as **ebooks**  in the internet,
just as their physical cousins
can on a book shelf.

For this wrongful purpose, the **electronic book**  was invented.

But in the internet,  **ebook** is merely a metaphor -- and a false one at that.
There is no *analogue* to books in the digital world.
The metaphor of the **ebook** just makes no sense.

Storage and transmission of information have become much simpler today,
but some valuable benefits of the printed book have been lost:

- A printed book can be easily traded as a commodity. With digital information,
  however, we have a completely different situation. Why should one pay for something
  that cannot be touched or carried away?
- Intellectual property could be clearly defined and protected through books or
  documents. On the internet, however, any information can be copied or altered
  much more easily than has been the case before. 

However, today we have a technology available that can clearly define intellectual
property even in the digital realm: **The Blockchain**

This project will apply the concepts of the Web3 world to text as intellectual property.
Intellectual property can be a business again: **The Galactic Library
Of Intellectual Property** has come to the rescue.

This library will **dissolve** ebooks and make them accessable and tradable in slices, using
a database: **Sell content, not ebooks.**

## Case Study: A Novel by Charles Dickens.

The novel *Great Expectations* by Charles Dickens is available as a free **ebook**. The author's copyright has
expired. This makes this classic a suitable case study
for the **GLIP** (*Galactic Library
Of Intellectual Property*).

The *ebook* is extracted and its components are transferred to a MongoDB database. At appropriate points,
metadata about the content is added. This metadata
enables the novel to be linked with an **NFT**.

## Status

### Monday 2024/02/26

I am currently preparing a road map setting milestones for both backend and frontend. 
Backend: Unpack epub ebooks and upload it to MongoDB while at the same time modifying and enriching the structure. There must be so much concept behind this, that I
can generalize the method to other text formats. Frontend: Will be based on Next.js/Vercel, like my blog. I already took some time to hack into the blog and extend it by authentication based on MetaMask. When I did the initial basic steps on the backend I will go on with the frontend that will offer a NFT powered reading subscription service. The content is unspecified at the moment, it could be news, novel, all sorts of literature, even video. The basic archtiecture is supposed to be generic, but I will have to decide soon what really should be implemented for the POC.
