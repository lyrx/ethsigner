# The Galactic Library Of Intellectual Property
![](library.webp)

There is a misconception that has not been overcome since we can
send and store knowledge digitally.

It is mistakenly believed that **books** can exist in the internet, as they
can on a book shelf.

For this wrongful purpose, the **electronic book** or **ebook** was invented.

But in the internet,  **ebook** is merely a metaphor -- and a false one at that.
There is no *analogue* to books in the digital world.
The metaphor of the **ebook** just makes no sense.

Storage and transmission of information have become much simpler today,
but some valuable benefits of the printed book have been lost:

- A printed book can be easily traded as a commodity. With digital information,
  however, we have a completely different situation. Why should one pay for something
  that cannot be touched or carried away?
- Intellectual property could be clearly defined and protected through books or
  documents. On the internet, however, any information can be copied or altered
  much more easily than has been the case before. 

However, today we have a technology available that can clearly define intellectual
property even in the digital realm: **The Blockchain**

This project will apply the concepts of the Web3 world to text as intellectual property.
Intellectual property can be a business again: **The Galactic Library
Of Intellectual Property** has come to the rescue.


# ebooks

- Limit ebooks  to a specific number of copies
- There will be a script automatically editing each ebook by adding a signature based on
  an Ethereum address alongside the epub, plus injecting a unique serial number directly into the epub.
    - That will make the hash value of each copy unique.
    - Each copy can subsequently be uploaded to IPFS, maintaining uniqueness
- Scripts will provide a process similar to a signing and printing
  machine.
    - Sign each copy automatically and individually
    - Upload each copy to IPFS automatically
- Another repo will be used to provide a shop frontend based on Next.JS / Vercel

# Road Map

Basically I am creating a unique edition of the same ebook by injecting
a serial number into each copy. In a second step I create an NFT ERC721 smart contract representing
the eBook and ownership of each copy. You buy the NFT, you buy exactly one unique copy of
the ebook. You have the right to download exactly that copy.

**Remark** I started this project with a simple signature verification function. But this
will be redundant of course, as signatures will be dealed with internally by the NFT.
